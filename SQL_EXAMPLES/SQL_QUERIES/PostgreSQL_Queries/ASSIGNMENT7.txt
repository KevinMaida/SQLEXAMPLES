--PROBLEM SOLVED: Write a query that shows the student's name, the courses the student is 
--taking and the professors that teach that course. 
SELECT student_name, student_enrollment.course_no, last_name
FROM students INNER JOIN student_enrollment
ON students.student_no = student_enrollment.student_no
INNER JOIN teach ON student_enrollment.course_no = teach.course_no;

--PROBLEM SOLVED: In question 3 you discovered why there is repeating data. How can we eliminate 
--this redundancy? Let's say we only care to see a single professor teaching a course and we don't
--care for all the other professors that teach the particular course. Write a query that will 
--accomplish this so that every record is distinct.
SELECT student_name, student_enrollment.course_no, last_name
FROM students INNER JOIN student_enrollment
ON students.student_no = student_enrollment.student_no
INNER JOIN teach ON student_enrollment.course_no = teach.course_no
WHERE last_name IN (SELECT MAX(last_name) FROM teach GROUP BY course_no);

--PROBLEM SOLVED: In the video lectures, we've been discussing the employees table and the 
--departments table. Considering those tables, write a query that returns employees whose salary
--is above average for their given department.
SELECT *
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department = e2.department GROUP BY department);

--PROBLEM SOLVED: Write a query that returns ALL of the students as well as any courses they
--may or may not be taking. 
SELECT students.*, course_no
FROM students LEFT JOIN student_enrollment
ON students.student_no = student_enrollment.student_no;
