--PROBLEM SOLVED: Write a query that displays 3 columns. The query should display the fruit and its
--total supply along with a category of either LOW, ENOUGH or FULL. Low category means that the 
--total supply of the fruit is less than 20,000. The enough category means that the total supply 
--is between 20,000 and 50,000. If the total supply is greater than 50,000 then that fruit falls 
--in the full category. 
SELECT name, total_supply, CASE WHEN total_supply < 20000 THEN 'LOW'
						  				WHEN total_supply BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'ENOUGH'
						  				WHEN total_supply > 50000 THEN 'FULL'
					  					END as category
FROM (SELECT name, SUM(supply) total_supply FROM fruit_imports GROUP BY name) a

--PROBLEM SOLVED: Taking into consideration the supply column and the cost_per_unit column, you 
--should be able to tabulate the total cost to import fruits by each season. The result will look
--something like this:"Winter" "10072.50" etc.
SELECT season, SUM(supply * cost_per_unit) as total_cost
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY season

--PROBLEM SOLVED: Write a query that would transpose this data so that the seasons become columns 
--and the total cost for each season fills the first row?
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Winter' THEN total_cost END) as Winter, 
	   SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Spring' THEN total_cost END) as Spring,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Summer' THEN total_cost END) as Summer,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Fall' THEN total_cost END) as Fall,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'All Year' THEN total_cost END) as "All Year"
FROM (SELECT season, SUM(supply * cost_per_unit) as total_cost
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY season) a
