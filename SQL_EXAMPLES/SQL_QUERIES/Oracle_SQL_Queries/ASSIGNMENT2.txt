--PROBLEM SOLVED: Considering the data exists in the city table, write a query that will return records similar to what
--is shown below for those cities that have the COUNTRYCODE of 'cbd' :
--"NEW YORK CITY has the population of 8,500,000"
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(name), ' has the population of ', population)
FROM city
WHERE LOWER(countrycode) = 'cbd';

--PROBLEM SOLVED: Write a query that would show the first three letters and the last three letters of the DISTRICT capitalized and separated by a dash.
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(district, 1, 3)), '-', UPPER(SUBSTR(district, LENGTH(district) - 2)))
FROM city;

--PROBLEM SOLVED: Review the following SQL statement:
--SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN(LAST_DAY('15-JAN-12') + 1, '01-APR-12') FROM DUAL;
--Considering the database is configured for the given date format, what will be the result of executing the query?
--ANSWER: the last day function will take the last day of january and add 1 day to it bringing it to the first day of february.
--Since the smaller date is the first argument in the months between function, the result will be a negative 2.
